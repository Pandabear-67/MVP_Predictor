# NBA MVP Predictor

A model built on decision trees that predicts the NBA MVP.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, Selenium, BeautifulSoup

The model is trained on player and team stats starting from the 1990 season. Why 1990? I wanted to consider data that would be from the "Modern Era" of basketball to help capture trends in an evolving game. Player stats like point per game (ppg), assists per game (apg), rebounds per game (RBG) and advanced stats like VORP played a major role in helping to predict the MVP. The model, after updates from the final day of the 2023-2024 season, predicted Nikola Jokic as the MVP which aligns with the official NBA MVP Ladder as well as other highly credible MVP award trackers.

**Was playing with decision trees and decided to make an interesting project that would predict the MVP for this NBA season. For those who don't watch basketball, MVP is considered the best performing player in the regular season. I built a model using decision trees like XGBoost and Random Forest to predict the share of votes a particular player might get. After the regular season has ended on April 14th, I ran the model and it predicts Nikola Jokic to be MVP which is consistent with NBA's MVP ladder and many other highly credible basketball related websites**
