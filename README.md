# NBA MVP Predictor

A model built on decision trees that predicts the NBA MVP.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, Selenium, BeautifulSoup

The model is trained on player and team stats starting from the 1990 season. Why 1990? I wanted to consider data that would be from the "Modern Era" of basketball to help capture trends in an evolving game. Player stats like point per game (ppg), assists per game (apg), rebounds per game (RBG) and advanced stats like VORP played a major role in helping to predict the MVP. The model, after updates from the final day of the 2023-2024 season, predicted Nikola Jokic as the MVP which aligns with the official NBA MVP Ladder as well as other highly credible MVP award trackers.
