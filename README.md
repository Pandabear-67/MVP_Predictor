**NBA MVP Model**


**Was playing with decision trees and decided to make an interesting project that would predict the MVP for this NBA season. For those who don't watch basketball, MVP is considered the best performing player in the regular season. I built a model using decision trees like XGBoost and Random Forest to predict the share of votes a particular player might get. After the regular season has ended on April 14th, I ran the model and it predicts Nikola Jokic to be MVP which is consistent with NBA's MVP ladder and many other highly credible basketball related websites**
